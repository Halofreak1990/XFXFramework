= What is XFX?
================
XFX or XNA For XBOX is a set of libraries created on top of OpenXDK to allow XNA-style 
programming on the XBOX console.
Almost every function you can find in the XNA 2.0 libraries is present here,
so you've got all the tools required to create stunning games and apps for the XBOX.
Also, because the functions match those in the XNA libraries, you can use the MSDN documentation
in case you need to know the specifics about any function. Just don't forget you're coding in C++,
instead of C#.

NOTE: because of limitations, the XNA 'Content Pipeline' is not represented.
Instead, files are processed as necessary when loaded by the program, and not at compile time.
If you want, though, you can use .xnb files with XFX, as loading them has been implemented in
the ContentReader

============
The XFX Framework consists of the following libraries:

libmscorlib.a
	Custom implementation of the XBOX360 mscorlib.dll file, used to specify data types used
	by the XFX libraries, and for easier general purpose XBOX programming

libSystem.a
	Custom implementation of the XBOX360 System.dll file.

libSystem.Xml.a
	Custom implementation of the XBOX360 System.Xml.dll file, implementing Xml manipulation
	on the XBOX console.

libXFX.a
	Custom implementation of the XBOX360 version of the Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll
	This is the core of XFX, allowing XNA-style coding for the XBOX console.

libXFX.Game.a
	Custom implementation of the XBOX360 version of the Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dll

= Requirements
================
To compile software with these libraries, you'll need the following:

Basic Cygwin installation, with at least the following components:
	- autoconf
	- automake
	- binutils
	- gcc-3 (NOTE: version 3 is preferred due to compatibility issues with gcc-4)
	- g++-3 (NOTE: version 3 is preferred due to compatibility issues with g++-4)
	- make

OpenXDK 0.0.7 or higher


That's pretty much it.
See the makefile for file locations.

* For editing the XFX Framework's source code, we advise you install Visual Studio 2005
or higher, since it is what we used to manage the source code ourselves. IntelliSense really helped
speed up the coding, and being able to go to faulty code with just a double-click is just perfect.
One thing, though: In order to successfully be able to compile the XFX libraries from within VS2005,
one thing is needed after the install of Cygwin; You will need to add the Cygwin bin directory,
often located at C:\cygwin\bin to the PATH environment variable, so Visual Studio can access make.exe
